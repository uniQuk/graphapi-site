      "description": "Retrieve a list of educationOutcome objects. There are four types of outcomes: educationPointsOutcome, educationFeedbackOutcome, educationRubricOutcome, and educationFeedbackResourceOutcome. Only teachers, students, and applications with application permissions can perform this operation. A submission for a credit assignment (one that has no point value and no rubric) has an educationFeedbackOutcome. (It might also return an educationPointsOutcome, but that outcome is ignored.) A submission for a points assignment (one that has a point value assigned) has both an educationFeedbackOutcome and an educationPointsOutcome. A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a credit rubric (no points), has an educationFeedbackOutcome and an educationRubricOutcome. (It might also return an educationPointsOutcome, but that outcome is ignored.) A submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a points rubric, has an educationFeedbackOutcome, an educationPointsOutcome, and an educationRubricOutcome. A submission for a feedback resource has an educationFeedbackResourceOutcome. All outcome types have a regular and a published property appropriate to that type of outcome; for example, points and publishedPoints, feedback and publishedFeedback. The regular property is the most recent value updated by the teacher; the published property is the most recent value returned to the student.",
