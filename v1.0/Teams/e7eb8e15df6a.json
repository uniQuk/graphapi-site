      "description": "Archive the specified team. \nWhen a team is archived, users can no longer make most changes to the team. For example, users can no longer: send or like messages on any channel in the team; edit the team's name or description; nor edit other settings. However, membership changes to the team are still allowed. Archiving is an async operation. A team is archived once the async operation completes successfully, which might occur subsequent to a response from this API. To archive a team, the team and group must have an owner. To restore a team from its archived state, use the API to unarchive.",
